## Introduction

**MindSpore** is an AI computing framework. Fully developed by Huawei from the ground up, it implements on-demand collaboration across cloud-edge devices. It provides unified APIs and end-to-end AI capabilities for model development, execution, and deployment in all scenarios. Using a distributed architecture, MindSpore leverages a native differentiable programming paradigm and new AI native execution modes to achieve better resource efficiency, security, and trustworthiness. Meanwhile, MindSpore makes full use of the computing power of **Ascend AI processors** and lowers the entry requirements of industry AI development, bringing inclusive AI faster to reality.

**Huawei Cloudâ€™s ModelArts** is a one-stop AI development platform that enables developers and data scientists of any skill level to rapidly build, train, and deploy models anywhere, from the cloud to the edge.

In recent years, advances in computer vision have made qualitative leaps in almost every aspect of our lives. In the field of medical diagnostics, **pathology diagnosis** is one of the most accurate diagnostic methods. Building an Artificial Intelligence diagnosis machine would significantly speed up the diagnosis of cancer, and provide early treatment for cancer patients, which can save many more lives. The challenges faced today are the shortage of high-level pathologists and uneven level of diagnosis techniques, this even consolidates the need for large-scale autonomous screening systems.

To tackle the aforementioned challenge, **Huawei**, **Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation**, and **Guangzhou AnBiPing \(LBP\) Medicine Sci. & Tech. Co., Ltd.** collaborate to hold MindSpore Challenge - Pathology Diagnosis.

In this competition, pathological images labeled for the diagnosis of **peripheral pulmonary diseases** will be provided by **LBP Medicine**. Bronchoscopy brushing techniques are the method to sample these pathological images. Your team's goal is to develop and design an AI model with the assistance of **MindSpore** to **locate and classify cancer cells** in pathological images.

The bronchoscopy brushing methodology samples the patient's cells in the airways that lead to the lungs. We can obtain a pathology image by placing these samples under a microscope. A professional pathologist will view these images and identify the location and the classification of these cells. By automating this task, your participation could help to free an enormous amount of health professionals' time for pathological diagnosis.

Contestants are expected to train their model with MindSpore to localize and classify cells on biopsy samples. The competition is the form of a standard Multi-label Object Detection Task. Participants are invited to utilize the AI computing power on the Huawei Cloud's ModelArts equipped with Huawei Ascend 910 NPUs for model training.
