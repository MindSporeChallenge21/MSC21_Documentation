# Programming Environment

**Python 3.7.5** and **MindSpore 1.2.0** versions are the only versions where the evaluation queue accepts.

[MindSpore version 1.2.0](https://mindspore.cn/doc/api_python/zh-CN/r1.2/index.html) is the main library used for this competition, and the participants are required to use MindSpore as the development tool for designing their models. MindSpore contains a fully-fledged neural network toolkit for users to develop their model.

> All the models needed to be written with the **provided APIs in MindSpore** to be marked as **completed**.

## ðŸ›  Workshops, Training Sessions!

Contestants are expected to participate in the training sessions provided by the organizers to understand how to operate with the dataset, design models, training, and evaluation of the model. The training and evaluation process will only be running efficiently if the scripts are written correctly, and the MindSpore Ascend version of operators will significantly speed up your development and evaluation, which leads to faster experimentation cycles.

## Example

### [Github Code](https://github.com/MindSporeChallenge21)

The above working examples allow participants to have a starting sandbox for the competition. Participants should test on the local environment with the **`dataset_1`** so that the first training epochs on the training data can be performed.

The contestant can send messages to Discord to report or ask questions regarding MindSpore, Python, and the Submission of this competition.

> Our evaluation server supports only _**common libraries**_ that exist on **ModelArts**, if there are specific libraries that you may need for the evaluation, please send the inquiries to [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/SDpVGMxpWe) for the specific request.
