# Data

## üëÅüó® Overview

There are two formats of the data, which are the images and bounding boxes data. The data format is as follows, each biopsy sample will be an image. Contestants will be given a set of pictures with the name **sample\_0001.bmp**

## üè∑ Labels

The labels of the data are the bounding boxes \(**`xmin`**, **`ymin`**, **`xmax`**, **`ymax`**\). There could be more than one bounding box for each sample. For each bounding box, there will be a few associated classifications for the identified cells.

The classification is as follow:

| **Class** | **SCC** | **AC** | **SCLC** | **NSCLC** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| English Name | Squamous Cell Carcinoma | Adenocarcinoma | Small Cell Lung Cancer | Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer |
| Index | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Sub-class | NSCLC | NSCLC |  |  |
| Example Sample | ![](../../.gitbook/assets/0%20%281%29.png) | ![](../../.gitbook/assets/1.png) | ![](../../.gitbook/assets/2%20%281%29.png) | ![](../../.gitbook/assets/3%20%281%29.png) |
| Count in dataset\_1 |  |  |  |  |

## üè¨ Datasets

There are few versions of datasets. The primary dataset for user training and validation is **`dataset_1`**. This dataset contains 500 images.

| **Dataset Name** | **Publicly Accessible** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dataset_1` | Yes | 500 data points for experimentation and model design. |
| `dataset_2` | Restricted Access | User access through Huawei Cloud‚Äôs OBS, in ModelArts. |
| `dataset_3` | No | For Accuracy task, and Explainable task \(with masks\). |

## 1 Dataset 1

{% hint style="info" %}
The data\(dataset\_1\) can be obtained through the OBS bucket from Huawei Cloud of the following URL.

[https:////](https://google.com)
{% endhint %}

In the **dataset\_1** there are 500 images and a CSV label file, and after unzipping the data you will receive the file structure as below:

* images
  * sample\_0001.bmp
  * sample\_0002.bmp
  * ‚Ä¶
  * sample\_0500.bmp
* labels.csv

The labels contain few columns namely:

> **`image_id, xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax, scc, ac, sclc, nsclc`**

The labels \(**`xmin`**, **`ymin`**, **`xmax`**, **`ymax`**\) will be floating-point numbers between 0 and 1. For the x-axis, the related columns are `xmin` and `xmax`, the value 0 corresponds to the left side of the image, and 1 corresponds to the right side of the image. For the y-axis, the same idea applies, but with 0 value at the top of the image and 1 at the bottom corner of the image.

The classes \(**`scc`**, **`ac`**, **`sclc`**, **`nsclc`**\) is the classification of the cancer cells, because there are multiple classes per cell \(multi-label classification problem\), each class has a column with value 1 if the bounding boxes belong to the class. With the **`image_id`** the image filename can be obtained by concatenating the **`image_id`** with the **`.bmp`** file extension.

Contestants are expected to design a model for finding the bounding boxes for the samples and classify the diagnosed cells.
